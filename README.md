# Quality-Rate-Energy Measurements for Video Compression

This repository contains data and code from an investigation of quality-rate-energy aspects in video compression. It comprises two parts:
- [PCS 2024](./PCS-2024/): A comparative analysis on measurements using a software-based power meter against a hardware-based power meter. The outcomes of this were submitted as a paper in PCS 2024.
- [ICIP 2024](./ICIP-2024/): An investigation of the Energy-Quality curves to drive adaptive bitrate streaming. The outcomes of this were submitted as a paper to ICIP 2024.
